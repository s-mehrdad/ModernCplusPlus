# Introduction 
Concerning the new features of C++ language, while the project aims to serve as a personal private reference, it tries very hard to bring learning instruction, the source code itself and the compilation results all together in coding environment in easy language.


# Getting Started
1.  Installation process:
Both Visual Studio and Qt Creator (MinGW) IDEs have been tested. MacOs's Xcode and Cmake have been used to build too.

2.  Software dependencies:
Crossplatform on Windows, MacOs and Linux

3.  Latest releases:
The source code is released.

4.  API references
Windows's console: screen, colour and font manipulations APIs.

# Build and Test
If you are a beginner, use Visual Studio or know what you are doing.

Compile using CMake.
